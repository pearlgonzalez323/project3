<p><span>We prosper Intellectually because with our schooling we make every citizen up to a certain age go to school, and if they want to continue their education to become a specific thing like a doctor, lawyer, and ext. Also our religion is a very liberal religion and do not discriminate against any religion since our religion core values Kindness and Compassion. Even the religious leaders tell the people to show care to other religions like they are apart of our own. We also prosper Economically because because we have a tax that people have to pay every year and also land, and sales, so with those taxes it is used we can use it to make adjustments to our society as in adding and or replacing things. Also we have marketplaces for travelers who come into town, also what makes us cool is that we have our own currency but accept all other forms of currency. Another thing is that we have ships come in and out of our civilization because we are almost always trading with the other societies </span></p>
